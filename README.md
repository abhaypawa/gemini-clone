User Interaction and Experience: Enables users to type prompts and receive generated responses, mirroring the
functionality and UI of Google Gemini for a seamless and engaging experience.
• Feature Rich: ncludes a sidebar displaying search history and a ”new chat” button that opens new conversations,
enhancing user interaction and functionality.
• Project Focus: Employed Vite for fast development, ReactJS and Context API for efficient state management, and the
Gemini API for real-time response generation.
• Tech Stack: Utilized Vite, ReactJS, Context API, HTML, and CSS to create a highly functional and visually consistent
clone of Google Gemini.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
